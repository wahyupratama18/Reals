							<p>Envisioned to be an excellent and reputable university in providing educational services, Universitas Negeri Malang (UM) is committed to equipping the students to allow themselves to be life-long innovative learners. To materialise this mission, UM through the Office of International Affairs, supported by One Asia Foundation takes the opportunity to hold a series of courses on Asian Community, namely One Asia Lecture Series (OALS) in 2018 and 2019. Following the success of OALS, OIA in collaboration with the Department of English, Faculty of Letters, UM, proposed to Eurasia Foundation (from Asia) to hold EurAsia Lecture Series.</p>
							<p>Public perceptions of Europe and Asia has undoubtedly been shaped by popular culture. For example, to many Indonesians growing up in the 1990s, their understanding of Japan was very much shaped by the television series Oshin and Tokyo Love Story which were aired weekly on a national television. In both series, Japan is represented as a country with strong work ethics. The people are represented as having strong moral code, filial piety and, particularly in the latter, modern. On the other hand, the global success of the film adaptation of Crazy rich Asians challenges the popular stereotypical images of Asian women. The film offers female protagonists and supporting characters who are independent, highly educated and have strong self-determination. In short, popular culture can be powerful images shaping the audience’s perceptions of Europe and Asia, their culture and people. It can break negative stereotypes and foster mutual understanding among Asian communities and beyond. </p>
